        <h5>Version Control: Git and GitHub:</h5>
    	<i><h4>You Should Know About Git: What it is? and How it Works in Software Development?You Should Know About Git: What it is? and How it Works in Software Development?</h4></i>
        <vl>
            <li><text>Definition of Git: </text></li>
            <p>Git is a "distributed version control system" (VCS) that allows developers to track and manage changes to their codebase, over time. It enables several programmers to work on the project together, by keeping history of changes to files; and supporting branching and merging so that the development team can go back to previous versions of the project if needed. Git allows each user to have a standalone copy of the entire repository instead of just the current version of files, unlike version control systems that are centralized.</p>
            <li><text>How Git Works:</text></li>
            <p>It organizes project file snapshots in a more incremental way. These snapshots preserve the state of the project at different moments in time. Here’s a rundown of the fundamentals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Key Git Concepts</li>
                <N>*	Repository (Repo): </N> A repo is a folder that contains all of the project files, the entire commit history, and all of the versioning data. It can be local (in your computer) or remote (in platforms such as GitHub or GitLab).
                <br><N>*	Commit: </N> Like a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time. Each commit includes:
                <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - The changes made
                <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;•   A unique identifier (hash).
                <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;•   A commit message explaining the change.
                <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;•	Pointing to the parent commit (except for the first commit).
                </vl>
                <br><N>*	Branch: </N> : You can create an independent branch to work with a version of the project. The primary branch is usually named main or master, but other branches can be created for new features, bug fixes, etc. This separation means that developers can work on features while the swagger for the stable version of the code is unaffected.
                <br><textt>	Step 2: </textt><N>Staging Area (Index): </N>Files are added to the staging area before committing. This is where modifications are staged before committing them
                <br><N>Working Directory:</N>This is the local directory where the actual files are stored. Files which have had changes made to them are not being tracked by Git until they are added to the staging area.
                <li>Git Workflow:</li>
                <br>o &nbsp;	Here are the typical steps involved in your general workflow with Git:
                <ol>
                    <li><B>Clone a Repository: </B></li>If you are working on a pre-existing project, you clone the repository from some remote source (like GitHub) to your local machine using:
                    <br><br>&nbsp; *	git clone
                    <li><B>Push Changes to a Remote Repository: </B></li>Locally the changes are committed and then pushed to a remote repository (eg GitHub) using:
                    <br><br>&nbsp; *	git push origin
                    <li><B>Fetching Changes from a Remote Repo:</B></li>To see if anyone else has changed the remote repository, use:                    
                    <br><br>&nbsp; *    git pull origin
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <li><text>Importance of Git in Software Development: </text></li>Git is very vital in the current software development and the role of Git cannot be overemphasized. Here are the key reasons why Git is essential:
            <br><br> <N>* &nbsp;	Collaboration:</N><p>Git makes it possible for multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time without one developer’s changes affecting the others negatively. By means of branches every developer is able to develop new features as well as to fix bugs. Git makes it easier to deal with the merging of these changes to the master branch.developers can pull or merge requests to check and comment onthe changes to be incorporated into the project.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp;	Version Control:</N><p>Everyone who uses Git can see the changes that have been made to thecodebase over time. That is, if there is a mistake, one can go back to a previous version of the program or undo certain changes through the checkout command when using GitThis version control also enables developers to maintain different versions of the project (e.g.production, development, experimental) using different branches.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp;	Code Integrity and Quality:</N><p>Git assists in preserving the historical accuracy of the project's source code by documenting all changes made to the source. If a bug is detected, Git can help a developer to track down the point in time that this bug was created and which amendments introduce it. This is achieved by evaluating various commits and examining what was altered between the two images as a result of the deviation.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp;	Backup and Security:</N><p>Every developer is able to retrieve deleted files as a result of Git's distributed nature because everydeveloper has a complete copy of the project on their machine.Moreover, the project can be stored on services such as GitHub or GitLab and this is already an additional safe and offsite backup which prevents loss of important data.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp; Branching and Feature Isolation:</N><p>With Git comes the ability to branch out and work on separate bits and pieces of the main code so certain aspects can be isolated. New features or bugs can be added or fixed respectively without impacting the entire pre-existing code base. And once that new bit is complete, it can simply be snapped back to the main working area of the code.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp;	Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):</N><p>When there is a constant flow of new codes being integrated with existing ones, Git serves as one of the key components of the process. When such sudden changes occur to a code repository, Git is the feature that runs a bunch of automated tests and pushes the amended codes. There are multiple apps such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI and Jenkins that when integrated with Git support automatic testing that in turn boosts productivity.</p>
            <N>* &nbsp;	Code Review and Collaboration: </N><p>Synchronizing Git. Now that we have finished the integration of students’ repositories into the sister’s appropriate repositories, let us now take a moment to consolidate the knowledge we have acquired in this lesson. GitHub, GitLab</p>
        </vl>
        <i><h4>GitHub</h4></i>
        <vl>
            <li><text>Definition of GitHub:</text></li>GitHub is a popular multi-faceted purpose of securing repositories, code collaboration, and opensource projects contribution. 
            A three-dimensional view of these three elements is as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><k>Securing Repositories:</k></li><N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>*	Version Control: </N>To start with, repositories on GitHub are hosted using Git, which is a distributed version control system. This effectively means that once a developer's code is kept in a repository, it will be possible to monitor and control any alterations made on that code, even to the extent of restoring previous versions if need be.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Private and Public Repositories:</N>Another type of repository that can be created on GitHub is Private repositories which are retained and viewable only by the owner of the repository and, some selected collaborators, and a public repository which any person can have access to.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Storage and Access: </N>GitHub is said to be a cloud-based facility. Hence it is possible to access it from anywhere, making it easy to secure repository code and related documents, images amongst others.
                <li><k>Code Development:</k></li><N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>*	Branches: </N> Another structural form of protection of that code is through branches, whereby developers create branches or offshoots that allow them to create new features or fix bugs without impacting on the main code or the baseline version, which in most case is referred to as the main or master branch.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>*	Pull Requests (PRs): </N>In a situation when there are no improvements, the developer then proposes merging that branch into the initial one. That begins the procedure in which other potential team members can offer their feedback with suggestions concerning that change as well as endorse (or disallow) the modification.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Issues and Projects: </N>In addition, where developmental efforts are made, an issue tracking knitting helmet is integrated in GitHub.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Issues and Tasks: </N>Issues Tracker in the Github Sites supports the issue tracking where the developers can post tasks, bugs or feature requests with the aim of creating new things. The Contributionssection essentially aids in the collations and monitoring of effort expended.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Workflows and Integrations: </N>With GitHub Actions users can automate several processes like CI/CD and many more directly in the platform.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Pull Requests: </N>The process of code reviews is facilitated by GitHub where people in the same team review each other’s code before it is merged into the main branch. For specific changes made on the lines of code, inline comments can also be added.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Forking: </N> : Basically, to be able to participate in an open-source project, developers will have to fork the repository allowing them to make their own copy of the project. In case developers decide to make some changes, they will be able to send a contributing request afterwards allowing them to propose the changes to the parent repository.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Contributing Guidelines: </N> There are open-source projects which utilize the ‘CONTRIBUTING.md’ document to explain in details how contributors can participate in the project. This will most likely ensure uniformity and order in many contributions.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Star and Watch Repositories: </N> The users ‘star’ repositories they wish to favorite and ‘watch’ them if they want to get notification regarding activities like issues and pullrequests that occur on the repository.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Community and Discussion: </N> GitHub provides the facilities for an active community, with discussion board options available for contributors and maintainers to discuss topics on the project.
                <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Licensing: </N> Most open-source projects on GitHub use widely spread licensing like MIT, GPL, or Apache, which specify what can be done with the code: use, modification, or redistribution.
            </ol>
            <li><text>The Key Features of Open Source and Collaboration Are:</text></li>
            <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>*	GitHub Pages: </N> Static website hosting for personal portfolios or even project documentation is possible right from a repository.
            <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	GitHub Sponsors: </N> Allow users to financially support open-source developers and projects.
            <N>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>*	Contributions Graph: </N> GitHub keeps track of your contributions over time, showing your activity such as issues reported, pull requests merged, and code commits.
            <p>All these features combined, GitHub has become the de facto standard for software development, collaboration, and Opensource contributio</p>
